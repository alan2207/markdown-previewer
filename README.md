# Simple Markdown Previewer

* Created using react with the help of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#folder-structure) boilerplate.

* Markdown is being transformed using markdown parser called [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked).


### The user can enter markdown content in the textarea to the left, and it will be automatically transformed into HTML which will be properly rendered on the page.

### The app can be tested here:  [Live Demo](https://alan2207.github.io/markdown-previewer/)
